Turn left (same protocol for right; replace every right with left and left with right)
if signal recieved by the station is left, turn on left turn flag (LT_flag?) (this command is done in Proceed function)
Turn 180
	if left flag is on, and if the third inductor detects intersection, do Turn left

		left motor doesn't rotate (l_motor = 0 or a value close to 0)
	
		right motor turns on at a certain rate until right inductor detects the wire in the middle (like hits the wall) (till the right sensor has a reading to adjust) 
		(while right sensor is not reading middle wire)
	
		proceed
	
Turn 180 deg
if signal recieved by the station is Turn 180, do Turn 180

	left motor doesn't rotate (l_motor = 0)
	right motor turns on at a certain rate (different from Turn left/right until right inductor detects the wire in the middle (like "hits" a mag wall) 
	(till the right sensor has a reading to adjust) 
	(while right sensor is not reading middle wire)
	
	proceed
	
Stop 
if signal recieved by the station is stop (if the third inductor detects intersection), do Turn stop

	both motors = 0
	await for every other external signal (a bunch of if's statements?)
	
Proceed 
if signal recieved by the station is proceed, do Proceed
	
	read the wire position ( while(1) )
		if wire is within a range (in the middle), both motors turn at a certain rather equal rate
		if wire is to the right, increase rate of left motor, decrease the right motor by a little
		if wire is to the left, increase rate of the right motor, decrease the left motor by a little
		await for every other external signal (a bunch of if's statements? to check for flags)

Reverse 
if signal recieved by the station is proceed, do Reverse

	read the wire position ( while(1) )
		if wire is within a range (in the middle), both motors turn at a certain rather equal rate (but in backward direction)
		if wire is to the right, increase rate of left motor, decrease the right motor by a little
		if wire is to the left, increase rate of the right motor, decrease the left motor by a little
		await for every other external signal (a bunch of if's statements? to check for flags)
			(make sure that if turn left or turn right are set, that the car rotates 180)
